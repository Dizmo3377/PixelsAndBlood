## Description

PnB is a short, roguelike game developed using Unity. To complete the game, you must navigate through several dungeons, defeating enemies along the way, and ultimately defeat the final boss. Along the way, collect coins to purchase new weapons, potions, and other items to help you on your journey.

I have created this project as a part of my portfolio in order to better demonstrate my skills and knowledge in programming. You are welcome to download it for free and, of course, check out the source code!

**_Have fun!_**
